## Introduction to shell Scripting and user input

We use shell scripting to carry out repetitive tasks in a shell using Bash scripts which are a series of commands used and 

written in a file with a .sh extension from the command line or other scripts.

 First of all we have to get to the server using git bash  to set up the work enviroment.

   Below is a ready to use work enviroment.

## Shell scripting  Syntax Elements.

### Variables

 Alows you to define work in Bash

   they can store work in  
   
-  Numbers
-  
-  strings
-  
-  arrays
  
=  -assigns value to a valuable

$  -retrives value from a valuable.

  These two variables have been demonstrated below.

![=        $](https://github.com/NANA-2016/SHELL-SCRIPTING-/assets/141503408/395b8e7f-7e29-4415-b7be-962b7787e919)

### Control Flow

 These are if and else statements and are used depending on the condition.

 Below is a screen shot showing the if and else statements excecution using a code which propmpts you to type numbers and statements to say if the 
  
  number is positive or negative 
   .

  Below is an 'for loop' execution showing an example to print numbers.

### Command substitution

BacktrickS are used for command substitition  as well as syntax ie '' or $() as shown below.

![''            $()](https://github.com/NANA-2016/SHELL-SCRIPTING-/assets/141503408/9454f92b-769c-4946-a653-be2cd7614138)

### Input and output

 Some of thw commands used here are :
 -  read command to accept user input

 -  echo command output text to the console
 -  
 -   >output to a file

-  <input from a file

-  | pipe the output of one command as an input to another .

These has been demonstrated on the screen shot below.

### Function

Using bash, you can carry out these commands which allows you to modularize your code and make it more reusable for 

example declaring the function name follewed by parentesis as demonstrated on the screenshot below.
